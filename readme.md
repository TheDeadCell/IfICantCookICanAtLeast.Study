## Inspiration
We built a fun website that would provide a solid challenge for our team. The start of our process was sifting through a list of interesting API's and until we found one that caught our attention and fit the theme of food and agriculture. The website formatting was somewhat based on the golden ratio proportions, and the color scheme was loosely inspired by the dark mode aesthetics on sites like Discord and Reddit.  
## How we built it
Visual Studio Code, Github, ChatGPT (for debugging/educational purposes), HTML, JavaScript, CSS
## Challenges we ran into
Creating a website project made us run into various challenges, especially with new languages and tools, such as, learning JavaScript, linking files, using GitHub, and trying to properly utilize the API.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully picked up new languages like JavaScript and improved our coding abilities along the way. We learned how to effectively use Git and GitHub, including managing branches and resolving merge conflicts. We worked together smoothly, leveraging each personâ€™s strengths and maintaining clear communication, which helped keep the project on track.
## What we learned
We gained skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building our website. We also learned how to manage API data and integrate them into the front-end of a website. In addition, we learned a lot about the aesthetic aspects of designing a website.
